- Write a program which has UI to accept a ‘Weight’ and option to chose its ‘Unit’ and desire output ‘Unit’ it wants to convert to. Unit can be : MilliGram, Gram, KiloGram, Ounce, Pound, Stone. Take an external resource say file/Ini/Config , and populate it Weight Conversation Units.
- a.       The external file/ config should have all conversation ratio of the above Weight Unit. E.g 1 Kg= 1000 gram and so on
- b.      Your UI should use input controls to accept new weight , and allow user to convert it into Weight of its desire unit; and display it on same screen.
